**A native Linux/Windows/macOS Roblox Studio, written in Rust.** Open, edit and save
Roblox places, press Play and run them with real Luau, physics, characters
and GUIs, without Wine.

Rustudio is very much a beta/prototype, I wouldn't call it a studio replacement
quite yet.

> This project is still early, so please please help!! Contributions are super welcome. Come hang out, ask for help or report bugs on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/pdVZpADpWr).

## Features

- **Editor:** Explorer, Properties, Output, script tabs, move/scale/rotate
  tools with drag duplication and selection rotation, pop-out panels, terrain
  brushes and threaded generation, undo/redo, and Studio's menus and shortcuts.
  File > Studio Settings sets up the script editor, or opens scripts in your
  own editor (VS Code, Zed, Neovim or any command) and syncs the changes back.
- **Files:** `.rbxl` / `.rbxlx` places and `.rbxm` / `.rbxmx` models, plus
  project folders (`*.project.json` with plain files as the source of truth,
  Rojo/Argon sync rules, `sourcemap.json`, and File > Save as Project
  Folder… to turn any place into one).
- **Play / Run:** separate server and client, remotes, physics (rapier3d),
  R15/R6 characters with climbing and held jump, saved play settings, shift
  lock, sounds, tweens, 2D and 3D GUIs.
- **Luau:** the real Luau VM, with most of the engine API that real games
  call (see [docs/ENGINE-GAPS.md](docs/ENGINE-GAPS.md) for what's missing).
- **Rendering:** wgpu, with lighting, shadows, sky, atmosphere and materials
  tuned against Studio, incremental local lights and truss geometry. Meshes,
  FBX import and terrain are supported.
- **Roblox account:** open your places, load assets and avatars, use
  DataStores, and join Team Create sessions.

## Install

You need a Rust toolchain (1.85+) and a GPU with Vulkan (or OpenGL), or on
a Mac, macOS 11 or later (Metal).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rippelz/rustudio
cd rustudio
cargo build --release
./target/release/rustudio --demo           # sample scene
./target/release/rustudio my_place.rbxl    # open a place
```

On Windows (MSVC toolchain), run `.\target\release\rustudio.exe` instead,
and see the Windows notes under [Platforms](#platforms).

On Linux you can install it for your user instead, so it shows up in your
app launcher and runs as `rustudio` from anywhere:

```sh
./install.sh                # build, then install into ~/.local
./install.sh --uninstall    # remove it again
```

The install keeps working if you move or delete the cloned folder.
`./install.sh --help` lists the other options (`--prefix`, `--no-build`).

On first launch rustudio downloads Roblox Studio's built-in content
(default characters, camera and control scripts, fonts, textures, sounds;
about 60 MB) from Roblox's own CDN into `~/.local/share/rustudio/studio`
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\rustudio\studio` on Windows).
To get it ahead of time, or update it, run
`rustudio --install-studio-content`.

If you already have Studio installed (e.g. via
[Vinegar](https://vinegarhq.org)), you can point rustudio at that instead:

```sh
export RUSTUDIO_STUDIO_DIR=~/.var/app/org.vinegarhq.Vinegar/data/vinegar/versions/version-XXXX
```

On macOS, download `rustudio-…-macos-universal.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/rippelz/rustudio/releases) (Apple Silicon and
Intel in one), unzip it and move `rustudio.app` to Applications. It isn't
notarized by Apple, so the first time right-click it and choose **Open** (or
allow it in System Settings > Privacy & Security). To build the app
yourself instead: `tools/macos/bundle.sh` (`--universal` for both
architectures).

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 (Wayland or X11) | Supported, and the only one tested |
| Linux ARM64 | Should build; untested |
| macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon and Intel) | Builds and runs (tested on Apple Silicon); see below |
| Windows x86_64 (MSVC) | Builds and runs (tested on Windows 11); see below |

CI checks every push on Linux, Windows and macOS (where it also runs the
tests and builds the app).

Windows is new, so a few things don't work there yet:

- Paths in this README are the Linux ones. On Windows, data and caches go
  in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rustudio` (e.g. the Studio content download in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rustudio\studio`) and settings in `%APPDATA%\rustudio`.
- Signing in is untested (the session cookie now goes through the
  Windows Credential Manager, like the publishing key).
- Video playback is off (libvpx/libopus are loaded only on Linux), and a
  native crash doesn't write a crash report (panics still do).

On macOS:

- Data and settings go in `~/Library/Application Support/rustudio`, caches
  and crash reports in `~/Library/Caches/rustudio`.
- With Roblox Studio installed (`RobloxStudio.app`), rustudio uses its
  content and downloads nothing.
- Shortcuts are Studio for Mac's (⌘ for Ctrl, ⌥ for Alt; the delete key
  deletes), ⌘Q asks about unsaved changes, and places and models open from
  Finder. The session cookie goes in the login Keychain, and deleted project
  files in the Trash.
- Video playback needs `brew install libvpx opus`. Gamepads aren't read yet.

## Signing in

Everything above works signed out. To open your own places or load private
assets, sign in with your Roblox session: use the account button at the top
right and **Sign in with your browser** (rustudio shows a code that you
confirm on roblox.com, in whatever browser you're signed in to), paste the
`.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie there, or put it in `~/.config/rustudio/roblox-cookie`
(macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/rustudio/roblox-cookie`; `chmod 600`).
rustudio stores it in your login keyring (the Keychain on macOS). Details are in
[docs/AUTH.md](docs/AUTH.md).
