# UI parity with Studio (rounds 16–18)

The reference is an offline Studio (hidden, 1280×891), looked at over
its a Studio MCP bridge MCP: screenshots of the window, every menu popup and submenu,
every ribbon tab, the test drop-down, the account menu, the Explorer and its
context menus are in `checks/ui/studio/`; `list_actions` gave every item's
text and shortcut. rustudio's side is `rustudio PLACE --window 1280x891
--ui-shots DIR`, and `tools/ui_compare.py DIR` writes the pairs to
`checks/ui/side-*.png` (`checks/ui/index.md`). Names and icon art stay
rustudio's own (Tabler Icons, MIT, CREDITS.md); layout, words, order and
behaviour follow Studio.

Status: **done** = matches Studio; **partial** = as noted; **open** = not yet.

## Properties (round 17)

Captured: Studio's Properties for a Part, a Model, a Script, a ScreenGui and
Lighting, scrolled top to bottom (`checks/ui/studio/props-*.png`), next to
rustudio's in `checks/ui/side-props-*.png`. The row model is checked against
all five by the unit test `props_layout::matches_studio_captures`, and the

| Item | Studio | rustudio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Header | "Properties - Class "Name"" | the same, in the panel title | done |
| Filter | "Filter Properties (Ctrl+Shift+P)", always shown | the same; Ctrl+Shift+P focuses it; filters row names | done |
| Categories and order | Appearance, Data, Transform, Pivot, Behavior, Collision, Part, Assembly, Surface Inputs, Surface, the rest A–Z, Permissions, then Tags and Attributes | the same (props_layout.rs). From Studio's data: each property's category (API dump), hidden ones (Hidden / NotBrowsable / Deprecated, ReflectionMetadata Browsable), the order within a category (ReflectionMetadata PropertyOrder, then A–Z ignoring case). From the captures: the category order, Archivable under Data, the rows left out (Rotation, Disabled and Source of scripts, PredictionMode, Capabilities, Sandboxed, ModelStreamingMode…), CanQuery hidden while CanCollide is on, Permissions only for Models and scripts, Surface collapsed | done |
| Transform / Pivot rows | Size; CFrame, Origin, PivotOffset, WorldPivot as fold rows with Position / Orientation under them | the same, editable | done |

| Worked-out rows | Mass 6.72 (4 × 1.2 × 2 × 0.7), AssemblyMass inf when anchored, AssemblyRootPart, AssemblyCenterOfMass; Current / CustomPhysicalProperties as ticks; a ScreenGui's AbsoluteSize = the view's size; every instance has a UniqueId | the same (Custom starts from Plastic's values when ticked); a UniqueId not saved yet shows the instance's session id | done |
| Tags / Attributes | own sections with +, "No Tags have been added yet" / "No Attribute has been added yet" | the same, with + to add and × to remove | done |
| Panel width | 407 px at 1280 px | 298 px (rustudio's dock; the fidelity harness's viewport size depends on it), so long names clip earlier | different on purpose |
| Model "Scale" reset arrow | a ↶ reset button at the row's right | not drawn | open |

## Properties editors (round 18)

Captured in an offline Studio by opening each editor on a Part
(`checks/ui/studio/brickcolor-popup.png`, `color-dialog.png`,
`color-dialog-picked.png`, `props-slider.png`, `props-color-row.png`);
pairs in `checks/ui/side-brickcolor-popup.png`, `side-color-dialog.png`,
`side-props-slider.png` (`tools/ui_compare.py … --editors DIR`, from
`RUSTUDIO_UI_SHOTS=editors`). Self-tests `brickcolor-palette`,
`color-dialog`, `property-slider`.

| Item | Studio | rustudio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| BrickColor editor | clicking the value opens `ColorPickerPopup` (368 × 400): a honeycomb of pointy-top hexagons (26 × 29, 27.75 px apart, rows 24 px apart, each row offset half a cell), rows of 7, 8 … 13 … 8, 7 holding `BrickColor.palette(0 … 126)` in order (read from Studio and matched cell by cell to the capture), a row of 12 greys (1003, 199, 194, 1002, 325, 348, 26, 302, 311, 320, 335, 1001), a "More Colors" button; the current colour ringed red outside yellow; each cell edged at about 0.64 × its colour | the same layout, colours and order (`src/color_editors.rs`); click sets the BrickColor (a part's Color follows) in one undo step; Esc or a click outside closes; More Colors opens Select Color | done |
| Hovered colour's name | the cells carry Studio's BrickColor names (Studio.App.RobloxCustomWidgets.BrickColor<n>); no visible hover change reached the hidden Studio's synthetic pointer, so the tooltip wasn't captured | the hovered cell gets a white ring and its name beside the pointer | done (look of the name not captured) |
| Color editor | clicking the row shows a swatch button and "r, g, b" text; the swatch opens Qt's `QColorDialog` "Select Color" (522 × 399): 48 basic colours (18 × 14 cells on a 28 × 24 pitch, Qt's fixed set), Pick Screen Color, 16 custom colours, Add to Custom Colors, the 220 × 200 hue × saturation field (value 200, hue falling left to right) with a black cross, the 13 × 200 value strip with its arrow, one 58 × 106 swatch of the current colour, Hue / Sat / Val and Red / Green / Blue spin boxes (43 × 21), Hex (93 × 21), OK / Cancel (75 × 25) | the same layout and sizes; the field, strip, cells, spin boxes (type, arrows, wheel), Hex and Pick Screen Color (click anywhere in rustudio) all edit; a click in the field at the same point gave Studio's colour exactly (109, 32, 165) | done |
| Before / after swatch | Studio's dialog has one swatch (the current colour) | one swatch, as Studio | as Studio (no before / after) |
| Live editing | the part recolours while the dialog is open; OK keeps it as one undo step (two field clicks, OK, one Undo → the old colour); Cancel puts the old colour back | the same | done |
| Typing a colour | the row's "r, g, b" text | the same | done |
| Slider rows | a property gets a slider when ReflectionMetadata gives UIMinimum and UIMaximum (303 members: Transparency, Reflectance, Lighting Brightness / ClockTime / ShadowSoftness / ExposureCompensation, Sound Volume / PlaybackSpeed, ParticleEmitter Rate / Speed / Drag…); step = range / UINumTicks, 20 steps without it (measured: Transparency 0.05, ParticleEmitter.Drag 0–5 in 0.25, ShadowSoftness 100 ticks in 0.01); SliderScaling "Square" | the same rules, read from Studio's ReflectionMetadata.xml (`src/prop_slider.rs`); Square spaces values quadratically | done |
| Slider look | on the picked row: a 65-px spin box (value, up / down arrows) then the slider (9 × 14 handle (53, 55, 65), 2-px groove), on (40, 41, 49); the name cell in the selection blue (19, 35, 93) | the same; shown on hover too (the person's request; Studio shows it once the row is clicked) | done |
| Slider editing | dragging sets the value live; arrows step by one tick; typing in the spin box | the same; a drag is one undo step | done |

## Output (round 17)

Captured: Studio's Output after a script that prints, warns and errors, with
and without timestamps, in Run and in Play (`checks/ui/studio/output*.png`);
pair in `checks/ui/side-output.png`.

| Item | Studio | rustudio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Colours | by message type from the theme: Log MainText (188, 190, 200); Information InfoText (143, 180, 255); Warning (245, 118, 48) and Error (231, 87, 80) DemiBold; System SensitiveText (223, 106, 247) | the same, Builder Mono (Bold: no semi-bold face ships) | done |
| Line form | "message - Script:line"; errors "Full.Name:3: boom - Script:3", then "Stack Begin", one "Script 'Full.Name', Line N - function f" (or without " - function") per Luau frame, "Stack End", in blue | the same, every Luau frame from `debug.traceback` | done |
| Timestamps | "HH:MM:SS.mmm  " local time, off by default (⋯ > Show Timestamp) | the same | done |
| Context bar | green (0, 204, 103) for server lines (Run included), blue (52, 154, 213) for client lines; none on stack lines | the same | done |
| Toolbar | All Messages, All Contexts, Filter…, clear, ⋯ | the same; ⋯ holds Show Timestamp / Show Context / Show Source | done |
| Line pitch | 15 px | 15 px | done |

the API dump (`api-dump.json`); the engine is `src/script_complete.rs`, the
popup `src/script_editor.rs`.

| Item | Studio | rustudio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|

| Signature beside the list | the highlighted item's signature and description | signature only (the dump has no descriptions) | partial |
| Icons | per kind | class icons for instances, classes and services; a lettered badge per kind otherwise (rustudio's own art) | partial |
